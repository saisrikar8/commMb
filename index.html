        <p>Scouting was founded by Lord Baden Powell. He was a lieutenant in the British Army. His motto was "Be prepared". One time, someone asked him, "Be prepared for what?".</p>
        <p>"Why, for anything," he replied. The things you learn in Scouting can help you all throughout life. For instance, first aid is very important. If someone is hurt or ill, you will know what to do.
        <h3>Scouting Comes to America</h3>
        <p>Baden-Powell began Scouting in Britain, but the power of one good turn brought it across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States of America.</p>
