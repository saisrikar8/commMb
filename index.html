    <p>Scouting was founded by Lord Baden Powell. He was a lieutenant in the British Army. His motto was "Be prepared". One time, someone asked him, "Be prepared for what?".</p>
    <p>"Why, for anything," he replied. The things you learn in Scouting can help you all throughout life. For instance, first aid is very important. If someone is hurt or ill, you will know what to do.
    <h3>Scouting Comes to America</h3>
    <p>Baden-Powell began Scouting in Britain, but the power of one good turn brought it across the Atlantic Ocean to the United States of America. When American businessman William D. Boyce was lost in London, a boy came and asked him if he could help. Boyce was vey impressed with the boy's actions and learned more about the Boy Scout movement. He realized that boys in America would want to be scouts as well. Therefore, he and some other businessman, educators, and political leaders started the Boy Scouts of America.</p>
    <h3>How Scouting Works</h3>
    <p>The goal for all boy scouts is to reach the final rank of Eagle. Each rank is a milestone that represents your skill level in Scouting. As you finish more requirements, your experience, skill, and reponsibility grows until you finally reach Eagle. However, you should also have fun. Merit badges are meant to show scouts new career paths and hobbies as well. To learn more, you can visit the official scouting site </p>
